# Technical Writer Assignment

This assignment will test your writing abilities. Once submitted, the team will meet and review your assignment based on a pre-defined rubric. If you receive a passing score, you will be contacted for a technical interview, during which you will have the opportunity to discuss your changes.

## Instructions

Create a personal repository containing all your changes in a new branch. You may clone this repository if you would like, but please don't fork and submit a pull request (PR) to this repository. If you need guidance in cloning a repository, check out the [Clone a Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) guide from GitHub.

The file [assignment.md](assignment.md), located in the `technical-writer` folder, contains text that is intended to go to a documentation reference page. Your task is to improve the text and help improve the reading experience. You have the freedom to change everything you feel is needed. This includes adding or removing content and changing the markdown elements such as headings, links, titles, images, and code snippets. All changes must comply with the [style guide](/style_guide.md) provided.

Create a PR in your repository when you have completed all changes and are satisfied with your results. Email the person you have been in contact with throughout the hiring process a link to the PR. Ensure the repository has public access so the hiring manager can review the PR. You can use Gitlab, GitHub, Bitbucket, or any other versioning control system to host your deliverable.

> **Warning**: Do not use ChatGPT or a similar AI tool to rewrite the assignment for you. The interview process is designed to flag the usage of AI.

## Assumptions

- The reader has basic knowledge of Kubernetes. The user is not an expert but has some experience with Kubernetes.
- The current text is a draft. You are a technical writer tasked with improving the text and content.
- Assume the content would reside in a formal documentation site.
- Users of all skill levels will read the content.
- This is not a [tutorial](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/clusters/public-cloud/deploy-k8s-cluster) or a [procedural document](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/clusters/cluster-management/remove-clusters) (Step 1 ... Step N). The content is intended to be a reference page for beginners and experts to find information about a topic. The content should provide enough information to help the reader understand the concept and how to use the various commands.

## Tips

- Create a new git branch before making any changes.

- Carefully review the [style guide](../style_guide.md).

- Use [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and its features.

- Research the topic if you have no prior experience with Kubernetes. Ask yourself how you could present the information that would benefit both a beginner and an expert.

- Ask yourself how the reference page you are editing can provide value in addition to the resource links provided in the text. _Hint_ - Replicating the official Kubernetes documentation is not the answer.

- Review grammar and language. Writing content littered with typos and awkward language results in a poor reader experience.

- Have someone review your writing to help you catch ambiguities and parts of the writing that may be confusing to read.

- Review your final changes with fresh eyes after some time has passed to catch language, flow, and typos.
