# Education Engineer Assignment

This assignment will test your writing and teaching abilities. Once submitted, the team will meet and review your assignment based on a pre-defined rubric. If you receive a passing score, you will be contacted for a technical interview, during which you will have the opportunity to discuss your changes.

## Instructions

Create a personal repository containing all your changes in a new branch. You may clone this repository if you would like, but please don't fork and submit a pull request (PR) to this repository. If you need guidance in cloning a repository, check out the [Clone a Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) guide from GitHub.

The file [tutorial.md](tutorial.md), located in the `education-engineer` folder, contains a rough draft of a tutorial. Your task is to improve the tutorial and help improve the learning experience. You have the freedom to change everything you feel is needed. This includes adding or removing content and changing the markdown elements such as headings, links, titles, images, and code snippets. All changes must comply with the [style guide](/style_guide.md) and [layout](layout.md) provided.

Create a PR in your repository when you have completed all changes and are satisfied with your results. Email the person you have been in contact with throughout the hiring process a link to the PR. Ensure the repository has public access so the hiring manager can review the PR. You can use Gitlab, GitHub, Bitbucket, or any other versioning control system to host your deliverable.

## Assumptions

- The reader has no prior experience.

- The current tutorial is a draft. You are an education engineer tasked with improving the content and learning experience.

## Tips

- Carefully review the [style guide](../style_guide.md) and [layout guide](./layout.md).

- Focus on the learning experience. What are some concepts that a beginner may struggle with? How can you help them understand the concept?

- Review grammar and language. Writing content littered with typos and awkward language results in a poor reader experience.

- Have someone review your writing to help you catch ambiguities and parts of the writing that may be confusing to read.

- Review your final changes with fresh eyes after some time has passed to catch language, flow, and typos.
